# docker-handbrake-cli
Docker container based upon Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 3.4 and the latest HandbrakeCLI from apt repository whose purpose si to post-process MKV videos and store them to my NAS automatically.

## Encoding Settings
This project includes some custom HandbrakeCLI presets which I use for encoding various video formats. These settings were based upon recommendations from (http://www.rokoding.com/ "ROKODING"). Check them out!

## Sample Video Files
This project includes a handful of MKV files enccoded at different bitrates which you can use to test this docker container. These videos were obtained from (http://www.jell.yfish.us/ "Jellyfish Bitrate Test Files"). They have example files in lots of other formats and bitrates, included some Ultra 4K files.
